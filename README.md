Building a service that exposes CRUD operations to MongoDB for a database for enemy soldiers
Within the framework of these operations, the following should be enabled:
● Retrieve
● Insert
● Update
● Delete
The operations should be implemented in the rest API:

● HTTP GET — This method is used to read any resource.
● HTTP POST — This method is used to write any resource.
● HTTP PUT — This method is used to update any resource.
● HTTP DELETE — This method is used to delete any resource.

The database will be called enemy_soldiers
The document collection will be called soldier_details
Record structure

● Unique numeric field ID
● first_name
● last_name
● phone_number
● rank
